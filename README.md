yeh.. it's just a car that tries to navigate the map.

You can add custom maps by making a pure black and white image with a 400x400px image and then exporting it as a .ppm file. Rename the `fname` variable to the name of the file without the extension. Place the file in the **maps** directory.

Run using the run.sh script.
